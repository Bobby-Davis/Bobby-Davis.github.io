    <h2>ePortfolio</h2>

  <main>
    <p>
      I’m a software engineer with a strong foundation in full-stack web development, 
      passionate about building scalable, user-focused applications. My background includes 
      experience in Java, Spring Boot, Angular, and MongoDB, with a focus on designing clean, 
      efficient, and secure systems.
    </p>

    <h2>Capstone Project</h2>
    <p>
      This capstone project showcases my ability to transform a command-line Java application
      into a fully functional web-based system. The project is a full-stack rescue animal management
      system built from the ground up using modern web technologies and industry-standard practices.
    </p>

    <h2>Key Enhancements</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Redesigned the UI using Angular for a modern, responsive interface</li>
      <li>Implemented advanced filtering, sorting, and pagination logic</li>
      <li>Integrated a secure RESTful API with Spring Boot and JWT-based authentication</li>
      <li>Utilized MongoDB to store and query dynamic animal data efficiently</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Code Review</h2>

    <p>
      A code review is a systematic process in which developers examine each other's code to identify bugs,
      improve code quality, and ensure that the codebase meets industry standards. It promotes collaboration,
      encourages learning, and helps catch issues early before they become costly problems in production.
      Code reviews are an essential part of professional software development workflows, used in both open-source
      and enterprise teams.
    </p>

    <p>
      The benefits of a code review include improved readability, better maintainability, consistency in coding style,
      and increased overall reliability of software. It also serves as an opportunity for knowledge sharing and mentoring,
      making teams more resilient and aligned in their practices.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the video below, I walk through the original version of my Rescue Animal Management System, a Java-based console program.
      I then explain the structured enhancements I implemented as part of my CS 499 Capstone Project. These enhancements showcase 
      my skills in software engineering, algorithm design, and full-stack web development using Angular, Spring Boot, and MongoDB.
      I highlight specific code improvements, architectural decisions, and technical challenges I solved during the transformation
      of the system into a web application.
